Hello and welcome, this is my blog where I shall some things that I learn.
I chose the name simply due to the alliteration and because I love DFIR.
Currently I'm not working in the role but I'm close enought to it that
I have not lost hope that I will get back into it one day.

I have a broad interest in a lot of things cyber and currently I have an
interest in learning more forensics and trying my hand at malware analysis.

Please enjoy your visit.
