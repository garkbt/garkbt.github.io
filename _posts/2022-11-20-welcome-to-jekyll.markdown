Hello and welcome,

I have never had a blog before so this is a new and exciting thing.
This blog will be a place where I try share things I learn and find interesting.
Most of which will be infosec related.

The name is just a bit of fun, I'm an amateur DFIR enthuisist and keen to learn more.
I'll be trying my hand at some malware analysis, some pentesting and forensics.
I'm looking forward to putting out some more content soon.
